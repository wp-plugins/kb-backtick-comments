Allows you to paste code into comments or posts by surrounding it in `backticks`, just like in the Wordpress.org support forums.

== Description ==

Although there are many plugins available for pasting code into posts, this is the first I'm aware of for pasting code into comments. It's very simple: To have code look right, all your commenters have to do is surround it in `backticks`, just like you can do in the Wordpress.org support forums.

For demos, check out the [KB Backtick Comments demo](http://adambrown.info/b/widgets/2007/11/29/announcing-kb-backtick-comments/) at my site.

One important note. This plugin will always work in comments, but it will not work in posts unless you first disable the visual editor.

= Support =

If you post your support questions as comments below, I probably won't see them. If the notes in the plugin file don't answer your questions, then post your support questions on a post in the [KB Backtick Comments category](http://adambrown.info/b/widgets/category/kb-backtick-comments/) at my site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `kb_backtick_comments.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

All done. Go write a comment on one of your posts with backticks around some code and see what happens.

This plugin is provided "as is" and without any warranty or expectation of function. I'll probably try to help you if you ask nicely, but I can't promise anything. You are welcome to use this plugin and modify it however you want, as long as you give credit where it is due. 

But please don't redistribute this plugin from anywhere other than right here. Unless months go by and it looks like I've completely abandoned this thing, let's not get forks going without a darn good reason; that just confuses people. But send me your improvements and I'll add them in and include a shout-out to you here.
